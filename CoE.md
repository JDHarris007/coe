## Incident Description

## What were the symptoms / impact?
> What behavior did we see?  Who was impacted?  What services were impacted?  What changes did we see on our dashboards/graphs?

## What discovery or investigation was done?
> What process was used? What tools were used? What did you find in each tool? What were your hunches or assumptions? What did you rule out? Was there an existing runbook addressing confirmation and mitigation steps?

## Timeline
> Incident timeline, from the time an issue started, through customer impact, ending with incident resolution. Which tasks had a positive impact on the outcome? Which tasks had a negative impact on the outcome? Which tasks had no impact on restoring service?

## 5-whys and Root Cause

## Overall learnings and recommendations
